        <h2>Letter from the owner.</h2>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I'm Max, owner of Rapid Rain Response and a tech entrepreneur turned water whisperer.</p>
        <p>Back in 2022 I bought an old house in the Mt. Washington
            area of Los Angeles which turned out not to be ready for the record rainfall we had that year.
        </p>
        <p>I had leaks, my neighbors had leaks, my grocery store had leaks... leaks were everywhere I went. But because
            all of L.A. was battling the rain, contractors were slammed. I ended up spending a lot of time myself
            helping neighbors, climbing on roofs, finding leaks, and stopping the rain from getting in. It occured to
            me this is a
            service people really need - a rapid response to rain leaks that bridges the gap until a contractor can
            arrive with a permanent solution.</p>
        <p>Now, Rapid Rain Response's specialized services, equipment, and skills even have veteran
            contractors calling us
            to diagnose water intrusion. Turns out that millions of dollars are wasted every year on the wrong solutions
            because contractors don't typically bother diagnosing problems. They'll rip out big sections of roof or
            recommend redoing
            whole walls because somewhere
            in there is a pinhole leak. With us, you fix only what needs fixing. To each
            problem a proportionate solution - to a pinhole leak a pinhole-sized fix.</p>
        <p>Call us to protect your home better and help you save money doing it.</p>
        <p>- Max Craig</p>
