        <h2>Letter from the owner.</h2>
        <p>Hi,</p>
        <p>I'm Max, owner of Rapid Rain Response and tech manager turned water whisperer.</p>
        <p>Back in 2022 I bought an old house in the Mt. Washington
            area of Los Angeles, and that same year our weather stretched the definition of "desert". My home and its
            flat
            roof were not ready for that record rainfall.
        </p>
        <p>I had leaks, my neighbors had leaks, my grocery store had leaks... everywhere I went - leaks. But because
            all of L.A. was battling the rain, roofers were slammed. I ended up spending a lot of time myself
            helping neighbors, climbing up on roofs, finding leaks, stopping the rain from getting in. It occured to
            me that this is a
            service people could use - a rapid response to rain that bridges the gap until a roofer can
            show up.</p>
        <p>Fast forward a year and Rapid Rain Response's specialized services, equipment, and skills have even roofers
            calling us
            to help them diagnose water intrusion. Turns out water is sneaky - gets in
            through the most unpredictable vulnerabilities. Also turns out we're really good at pinpointing those
            vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>What I hadn't anticipated is how much money we'd save clients. Roofers aren't diagnostic experts and don't
            have incentive to do the least work possible. They'll rip out big sections of roof because somewhere
            in there is a pinhole leak, then send you a big bill. With us, you fix only what needs fixing. To each
            problem a proportionate solution - to a pinhole leak a pinhole-sized fix.</p>
        <p>Our weather is changing. We're here to help you adapt.</p>
        <p>- Max Craig</p>
