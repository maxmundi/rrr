                quickly. Once the issue was identified he gave us various options on how to address it. Most importantly
                he was able to explain a topic we were clueless about in a simple, but thorough way so that we could
                make an informed decision. Thanks Max!"<br><br>- Ari P. (Yelp)</p>

                responded quickly and was able to come check out the house. He used his gear to locate several places
                where the water appeared to be coming through the roof, wrote up detailed instructions on how to patch
                and repair those areas and also tarped them off to temporarily prevent more water from getting through
                until repairs were made. Very helpful . Would recommend."<br><br>- Evan D. (Yelp)</p>

                areas on the roof. He was very professional and even worked to connect me to local roofer to fix the
